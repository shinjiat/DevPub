# DevPub
In this group project, I was asked to do the front-end and back-end alone: implement and design a [forum](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/tree/master/db/forum) and also assist other members on the files in this [folder](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/tree/master/db) such as the [editprofile.php](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/blob/master/db/editprofile.php), [crewpage.php](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/blob/master/db/crewpage.php) and etc.

##### Updated source codes were all deleted on my [friend](https://github.com/orgs/JDK-devpub/people/buyback)'s hostinger account, I'm unable to get any screenshot from the original online hosted Website unfortunately.
##### I am unable to replicate how the website would look like on localhost, due to missing too many updated files, table and hard-coded data on hostinger's database.
