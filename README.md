# DevPub
In this group project, I was asked to do the front-end and back-end alone: implement and design a [forum](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/tree/master/db/forum) and also assist other members on the files in this [folder](https://github.com/shinjiat/DevPub-Website/tree/master/db) such as the editprofile.php, crewpage.php and etc.

## Screenshots will be added by 29th.
